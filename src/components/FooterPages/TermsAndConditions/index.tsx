						<b>Limitation of Liability</b>
						<br></br>
						Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the
						entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers
						under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive
						remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the
						amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100
						USD if You {"haven't"}

						any way related to the use of or inability to use the

						the Company or any supplier has been advised of the
						possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails
						of its essential purpose.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied
						warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
						consequential damages, which means that some of the
						above limitations may not apply. In these states, each{' '}
						{"party's"} liability will be limited to the greatest
						extent permitted by law.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						<br></br>

						respective licensors and service providers, expressly
						disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied,

						<br></br>
						Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain
						types of warranties or limitations on applicable
						statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the
						above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.
						But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set
						forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest
						extent enforceable under applicable law.
